# Waste-Sort
Waste Classifier is a web application that inform users where and how to correctly dispose of their waste. The program leverages a machine learning model to classify images of waste items into 1 of 8 categories (Paper, Plastic, Glass, Cardboard, Metal, Organic, E-Waste, Textile, or Landfill) and describe how the object should be disposed of correctly. The application also includes information of where items can be disposed of on ASU's campus, such as locations of recycling bins, compost bins, donations bins, and E-Waste drop-off areas. The web application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to promote sustainable and environmentally-friendly waste management practices for students and faculty at ASU.
